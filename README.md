ECE 111- Project 6 - Fall '18

MIPS Processor with Co-processor 1 (Single-Precision Floating Point Unit)
Design a 32-bit MIPS processor with the following specifications
• Supported assembly commands: ADD, SUB, ADDI, ADD.S, AND, OR, XOR, BEQ, J, LW, SW, LWC1, SWC1.
• 32 general-purpose 32-bit registers (you can define additional registers as needed).
• 32 32-bit registers for floating point unit.
• 64-byte instruction memory.
• 64-byte data memory.
• The processor should halt execution after all the instructions in the instruction memory is executed.
